The code was using None to\nrepresent empty tree, usefull for example when we need to\ncompare a path between two commits (the path might be non-existant\nat one of the commits you are comparing).\n\nI think that in this case the right decision would be to raise\nsince is an exceptional case, caused by a corrupted repo,\nis more consistent with other tools, and ensures user code\ndoes not take the wrong decissions.\n\nFor curiosity the corrupted repository can happen more commonly\nthan expected. We run our repositories on a shared NFS filer,\nand one of our servers didn't have the lookupcache=positive\nflag. This makes NFS cache the metadata (files on a directory\nfor example) and use that for negative lookups (to deny existance\nof files). In this case, the commit object was on a directory\nnot cached, so the commit was seen immediately, but the tree\nobject was in a folder that was cached, the cache didn't\ncontained the tree object, and thus for some seconds the tree\nwas not existing and the repo was corrupted.
